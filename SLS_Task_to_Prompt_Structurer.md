# Task-to-Prompt Structurer
Author: Vincent Shing Hin Chong
## Overview

This application module demonstrates how natural language task descriptions can be transformed into structured, reusable semantic prompt modules using the SLS (Semantic Logic System) architecture.

Instead of requiring the user to write manually-layered prompts, the system leverages semantic control technologies to decompose high-level intentions into layered prompt chains. These structures are designed for compatibility with LLM systems, modular reuse, and controlled rhythmic output.

## Use Cases

| User Type           | Application Value |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| AI Prompt Designers | Automatically generate prompt scaffolds from task input |
| System Architects   | Convert operational processes into modular prompt blueprints |
| Educators           | Encode learning objectives into structured task modules |
| SaaS Builders       | Transform user tasks into language interfaces with reproducible patterns |

## Semantic Technologies Used

| Layer       | Technology                     | Function                                                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intent Layer | **ILS** (Intent Layer Structuring) | Extracts goals and constraints from task descriptions               |
| Structural Layer | **MPL** (Meta Prompt Layering)    | Translates task elements into modular, recursively layered prompts  |
| Rhythm Layer | **Symbolic Semantic Rhythm**       | Aligns structure flow, pacing, and modular output sequence          |
| Encapsulation Layer | **Snapshot Generator Module**      | Seals the resulting prompt module chain into versioned semantic units |

## Example Task Input (Natural Language):

> "Design a product introduction page with a short opening, three feature highlights, and a call-to-action."

---

## Expected Output (Semantic Structure):

```
[ILS]
Intent: Build a structured and persuasive product presentation  
Task Classification: Constructive composition task (informational + persuasive intent)

[MPL]
Module A: Introductory framing and value proposition  
Module B: Feature Highlight 1 (technical core)  
Module C: Feature Highlight 2 (user experience)  
Module D: Feature Highlight 3 (differentiation)  
Module E: Call-to-action segment

[SSR]
Module rhythm:
- Opening → Parallel feature modules → CTA  
- Each module includes: Title → Explanation → Supporting Example

[Snapshot]
Chain ID: ProductIntro-v1  
Context: Product copywriting, chatbot flows, structured content templates  
State: Intent-aligned, structurally sealed, reusable prompt modules
```

## Semantic Value

| Capability              | Enabled by SLS                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Task structure detection | Via ILS intent modeling                |
| Prompt decomposition     | Via MPL recursive layering             |
| Controlled generation    | Through SSR-guided output pacing       |
| Memory construction      | Using Snapshot-sealed reusable blocks  |

## Conceptual Role in Prompt-AI Systems

Unlike conventional chatbot flows that operate as reactive text generators,  
a system structured with SLS functions more like a **semantic circuit**—  
where each input intention is not only interpreted, but recursively structured,  
modularized, rhythm-aligned, and sealed for downstream control and reactivation.

> *One might say: We don't create the chatbot. We define its gravitational field.*
