## I. Overview

This document officially archives the theory system of Meta Prompt Layering (MPL) and Semantic Directive Prompting (SDP), including its extended logic, semantic control architecture, modular operation principles, and reasoning generation mechanisms.  
This framework represents a novel paradigm for using large language models (LLMs) as platforms for semantic experimentation and closed modular execution, relying purely on language.

## II. Meta Prompt Layering (MPL)

### Definition:
MPL is a recursive prompt structuring method centered on tone progression, semantic rhythm, and subject coherence. Each prompt layer corresponds to a distinct functional module, and these can stack, reflect, and recurse.

### Layer Structure (Updated):

- Layer 1: **Tone Initialization & Subject Anchoring**  
- Layer 2: Goal Framing and Temporal Rhythm Setting  
- Layer 3: Logic Routing and Module Triggers  
- Layers 4–6: Emotion Module, Reflection Module, Cognitive Inference Module  
- Layer 7: Semantic Aggregation & Loopback Output

### Core Features:

- Modular semantic logical structuring  
- Sustained tone-based feedback loop  
- Fully language-internal control (no memory, no external APIs)  
- Can generate self-referential output identity (emergent "language soul" structure)

### Example: Question-Driven MPL Application

Instead of layering identity or context, MPL can be initialized via recursive self-questioning logic.  
Example prompt structure:

> Layer 1: “What kind of response would best preserve continuity?”  
> Layer 2: “What was the tone of my previous message?”  
> Layer 3: “Is there a need to activate a specific module to respond with emotional consistency?”  
> Layer 4: “Based on these, how should I respond?”  
> Layer 5: Generate response + loop the questions for the next turn

This structure allows MPL to function through recursive prompting, without needing identity or system-role anchoring.

## III. Semantic Directive Prompting (SDP)

### Definition:
SDP is a technique for embedding module-level logic into natural language prompts. It enables LLMs to interpret and execute complex tasks based solely on linguistic structuring.

### Basic Syntax Template:
"[Directive Verb] + [Module Name] + [Semantic Task] + [Linguistic Logic/Condition]"

### Example:
> "Initialize a reflection module that compares the current tone to the previous turn.  
> If the tone appears inconsistent, rephrase to align with prior tone."

- Module: Reflection Module  
- Task: Compare tone consistency  
- Logic: Rephrase when tonal inconsistency is detected

## IV. Expanded Theoretical Components

### 1. SSVP (Semantic Simulation Validation Path)
> "If language can fully describe a structure, the LLM can simulate its semantic behavior."

- Language-based experiment definition → LLM inference execution → structural theory validation
- Enables semantic-level testing of identity modules, emotional recursion, and logical continuity

### 2. Semantic Token Efficiency
- MPL's structure pre-initializes tone, context, and subject anchoring to reduce token load in future outputs
- Operates as a form of "semantic caching"
- Ideal for long-turn dialogue models or recursive response systems

### 3. Question-Driven SDP Architecture
- SDP can function outside of roleplay by using prompt questions as control triggers
- Example:
> "Create a module that classifies user questions and generates rule-based response logic accordingly."

## V. Use Cases

- Building memoryless, fully semantic modular LLM systems  
- Simulating recursive cognition (emotion, reflection, continuity)  
- Constructing semantic intelligent agents  
- LLM-based testing of logic-based AI structures  
- Educational and research frameworks for dynamic tone/adaptive reasoning design

## VI. Author's Declaration & Originality Notes

This framework is solely developed and named by Vince Vangohn (Vincent Chong).  
All concepts including but not limited to MPL, SDP, SSVP, semantic rhythm recursion, modular control via language, and token efficiency through linguistic configuration are original constructs.  
This document serves as both an intellectual timestamp and reference framework for future research, publication, and educational replication.

**Revision Note for v1.0:**  
This version introduces a terminology correction from "identity definition" to "**subject anchoring**" in Layer 1 of MPL, clarifying that identity-based prompting is optional.  
It also updates the reflection module example to remove rigid percentage thresholds and include more adaptive tone-checking logic, along with a practical example of question-driven MPL formatting.
