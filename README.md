## üß† Overview

**Semantic Logic System (SLS)** is a full-stack semantic control framework designed for use within Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables modular, recursive, and self-sustaining language systems using nothing but language itself. SLS introduces a new paradigm: *language as a system‚Äôs internal logic.*

This repository contains the complete v1.0 white paper and associated modular specifications.

## üìò Included Documents

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sls-v1.9-wp-full.md` | Full white paper, including Chapters 1‚Äì8 |

## üìå Key Concepts

- **Meta Prompt Layering (MPL)**  
- **Intent Layer Structuring (ILS)**  
- **Symbolic Semantic Rhythm**  
- **Snapshot Generator Module**  
- **Module Chain Dynamics**  
- **Semantic Closure**

## ü§ñ LLM Compatibility

SLS is designed to operate entirely within LLM environments. It is compatible with:

- **OpenAI GPT-series (GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 / GPT-4-turbo)**
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **Google Gemini**
- **Meta LLaMA / Mistral derivatives**
- **Any transformer-based model that supports prompt-token interaction and long-context reasoning**

> No external plugin or API is required ‚Äî the system runs purely on language.


## Related Whitepaper

This framework is built upon and expands the principles established in:
[Language Construct Modeling (LCM) ‚Äî by Vincent Shing Hin Chong]([https://github.com/chonghin33/lcm-1.13-whitepaper])

LCM introduced recursive prompt logic and modular composition in language-first systems.  
SLS builds upon that foundation to construct a full semantic runtime environment.
