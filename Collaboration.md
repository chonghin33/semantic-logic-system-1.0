# Collaboration & Module Development Guide

## Vision

The **Semantic Logic System (SLS)** is not only a framework—  
it is a semantic environment, a structural language container designed to define how language can recursively build logic, modulate expression, and form operational modules.

We welcome collaborators interested in extending the logic, implementing compatible applications, or building on the core semantic technologies of **ILS**, **MPL**, **SSR**, and **Snapshot**.

---

## How to Contribute

We encourage developers, prompt engineers, researchers, and LLM tool designers to create SLS-compatible semantic modules.

All contributions should follow these structural guidelines:

- Modules must use **ILS** to define task intent
- Modules must be decomposed using **MPL**
- Outputs should follow a defined **Symbolic Semantic Rhythm**
- Final structures should be sealed using the **Snapshot Generator Module**

Please refer to the `/application/` directory for live examples.

## Technical Compatibility

The SLS architecture is designed to be model-agnostic and prompt-native.

| Feature         | Compatibility |
|------------------|---------------|
| GPT-4 / Claude 3 / Gemini | ✅ |
| JSON-output capable modules | ✅ |
| API-connected prompt orchestration | ✅ |
| LLM-native logic systems | ✅ |

---

## Collaboration Opportunities

We are actively looking for collaborators in the following areas:

- Prompt engineering frameworks based on SLS
- Recursive instruction or agent-based architecture
- Modular QA, workflow, or training systems
- LLM tool builders looking to standardize prompt logic
