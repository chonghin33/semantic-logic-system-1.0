# Semantic Knowledge Compressor

Author: Vincent Shing Hin Chong

## Overview

This application module demonstrates how the SLS (Semantic Logic System) framework utilizes its core semantic technologies—ILS (Intent Layer Structuring) and MPL (Meta Prompt Layering)—to convert long-form, unstructured or overly verbose textual content into modular, prompt-ready semantic blocks.

These compressed modules are rhythmically structured, semantically traceable, and reusable across LLM systems for:
- Auto-QA systems
- Semantic memory snapshots
- Recursive prompting environments
- Modular orchestration in AI agent flows

## Technologies & Module Structure

| Layer       | Technology                     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intent Layer | **ILS** (Intent Layer Structuring) | Extracts functional and structural intentions from unstructured language   |
| Modular Layer | **MPL** (Meta Prompt Layering)    | Decomposes intent-aligned segments into recursive semantic prompt modules  |
| Rhythm Layer | **Symbolic Semantic Rhythm**       | Controls output order, pacing, and structural alignment of modules         |
| Memory Layer | **Snapshot Generator Module**      | Encapsulates each semantic module into a reusable, versioned memory unit   |

## Example Prompt

> Using the following product safety clause, extract three semantic modules.  
> Each module must contain a functional intent, be rhythmically self-contained, and conclude with a snapshot summary.  
> Output should match the ILS → MPL → SSR → Snapshot format used within the SLS structure.

## Example Output

```
[ILS]
Primary Intent: Enable semantic understanding and structured memory of safety clauses
Task Goal: Convert safety requirements into rhythm-aligned prompt modules

[MPL Module Chain]
Module 1: Voltage Limitations
- Max input: 12V
- Surpassing threshold voids warranty

Module 2: Operating Temperature Range
- Recommended: 0°C to 45°C
- Usage outside range invalidates support

Module 3: User Liability Conditions
- Manufacturer not responsible for damages due to unauthorized modification

[Symbolic Semantic Rhythm]
Each module uses a 3-part structure: Clause + Rationale + Boundary Condition
Order follows decreasing risk priority for efficient LLM parsing

[Snapshot]
Chain Code: ProductSafety-ModChain-v1
Structure: ILS → MPL (x3) → SSR → Snapshot
Intended Use: FAQ generation, RAG prompts, structured memory for auto-agent response
```

## Real-World Applications & Value

The Semantic Knowledge Compressor enables structured transformation of long-form unstructured documents into reusable, modular semantic units. This allows organizations and developers to:

- **Prevent semantic loss** during LLM interaction by maintaining task-bound modular clarity
- **Reduce latency** in prompt construction and QA system retrieval workflows
- **Improve precision** of LLM outputs by supplying intent-layered, rhythm-aligned semantic structures

### Example Use Cases:
- SOP and internal manual compression for Copilot assistant systems
- Clause-level legal Q&A indexing and retrieval
- Recursive prompt generation for AI training or course material
- Modular orchestration templates for chat-driven AI flows

This pattern supports rapid reuse, multilingual adaptation, and structured memory building across all LLM platforms.
