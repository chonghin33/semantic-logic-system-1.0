## 🧠 Overview

**Semantic Logic System (SLS)** is a full-stack semantic control framework designed for use within Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables modular, recursive, and self-sustaining language systems using nothing but language itself. SLS introduces a new paradigm: *language as a system’s internal logic.*

This repository contains the complete v1.0 white paper and associated modular specifications.

## 🤖 LLM Compatibility

SLS is designed to operate entirely within LLM environments. It is compatible with:

- **OpenAI GPT-series (GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 / GPT-4-turbo)**
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **Google Gemini**
- **Meta LLaMA / Mistral derivatives**
- **Any transformer-based model that supports prompt-token interaction and long-context reasoning**

> No external plugin or API is required — the system runs purely on language.
