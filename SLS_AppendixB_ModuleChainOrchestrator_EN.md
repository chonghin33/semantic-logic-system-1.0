## Appendix B: Standard Module API Specification (v1.2)

### Module Example: Module Chain Orchestrator

This specification defines a controller-type module used to orchestrate the flow, interaction, and semantic consistency of modular chains within the Semantic Logic System (SLS). This type of module demonstrates how a single meta-module can manage, sequence, and recursively control a series of semantic modules.

```yaml
Module_ID: Mod_Chain_Orchestrator_001
Module_Type: Controller (Module Chain Orchestration)

Semantic_Core_Definition:
  Goal: Manage the execution order, dependency resolution, and loopback control of a semantic module chain
  Parameters:
    - name: chain_sequence
      type: list[string]
      description: Ordered list of module IDs to be executed
    - name: loopback
      type: boolean
      description: Whether the final module should callback to the Initial Node to form a semantic loop
      default: true
    - name: condition_map
      type: dict
      description: Dictionary defining trigger conditions and dependency rules between modules

Trigger_Conditions:
  - prompt contains: "activate module chain"
  - or: upstream module flags a "chain invocation request"

Execution_Logic:
  Entry_Point: Triggered upon receiving a semantic prompt that includes a valid chain_sequence
  Process:
    - Sequentially trigger modules as defined in chain_sequence
    - Pass each module's output into the context of the next module
    - If loopback = true, final output is routed back to the Initial Node for reinitialization
  Error_Handling:
    - On module failure or semantic inconsistency, fallback is determined by condition_map
    - Supports rollback or bypass logic depending on semantic state analysis

Output_Format:
  Type: Structured Summary + Execution Report
  Structure:
    - Execution Sequence Overview
    - Output Synopsis of Each Module
    - Semantic Chain Consistency Report
    - Final Node State (closed-loop status and reactivation requirement)

Semantic_Tags:
  - "module_chain"
  - "semantic_coordination"
  - "orchestration"
  - "closed_loop_control"

Sync_Behavior:
  Cache_Enabled: true
  Update_Mode: Results from each execution are recorded in the Semantic Memory Layer
                to optimize future orchestration patterns and support chain-level learning
```

### Key Technical Highlights

| Layer             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Semantic Control | Centralized coordination of module activation, ordering, and data flow     |
| Conditional Logic| condition_map allows dynamic routing based on module output or failure     |
| Loopback Support | Enables full semantic closure by redirecting flow back to the initial node |
| Recursiveness     | Chains may embed sub-chains for multi-level execution planning             |

This module type is essential for building recursive, resilient, and coordinated semantic infrastructures within the SLS framework.
